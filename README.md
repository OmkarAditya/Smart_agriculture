# Smart_agriculture
A SMART AGRICULTURE MONITORING SYSTEM(USING ARDUINO AND PYTHON) WHICH DETECTS HUMIDITY,TEMPERATURE MOISTURE PERCENT AND GAS READINGS AND DATA IS DYNAMICALLY FEEDED TO OUR CUSTOMISED WEBSITE THROUGH THINGSPEAK

Note: Before using the arduino code install the DHTLib zip file and add it in the arduino in sketches-include library-add zip file-

COMPONENTS: arduino, breadboard,dht11 sensor,mq135,soil moisture sensor 

SOFTWARE: Arduino, thingspeak, python 

CIRCUIT:

METHODOLOGY:

1. CIRCUIT EXPLANATION

We are using 3 sensors to print 4 data temperature humidity, gas readings and soil moisture. Data is dynamically feeded to the thingspeak which further sends to our website
